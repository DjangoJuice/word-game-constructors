// Contains a constructor, Letter. This constructor should be able to either display an underlying character 
// or a blank placeholder (such as an underscore), 
// depending on whether or not the user has guessed the letter. That means the constructor should define:
var Letter = function(letter, guess) {

    // A string value to store the underlying character for the letter
    this.letter = letter;
    this.guess = guess;

    this.answer = function() {
    this.answer = "pizza";
    this.answerArray = answer.split("");
        console.log(this.answerArray);
    }
    

    // A boolean value that stores whether that letter has been guessed yet
    
};

var letter = process.argv[2];
console.log("woah ", Letter.answer);
